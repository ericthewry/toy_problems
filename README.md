# toy_problems

All of the python files in this directory are solutions tointerview/algorithms
questions.

### Execution

All of these rely on input and output files, they are also both
developed for python2.7, but should work for python3. The standard execution method is

```
$(which python2) <filename> <inputfile> <outputfile>
```

If that doesnt work, you can try

```
$(which python) <filename> <inputfile> <outputfile>
```

### Contents

`block_stacking.py` a solution to the block-stacking problem
`block_stacking.pdf` a  writeup for the block-stacking problem
`stock.py` a solution to the longest nondecreasing sublist problem
